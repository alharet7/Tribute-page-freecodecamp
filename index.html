            <h3>Why did I choose him?</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="points">
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>He is a genius engineer and this is the main thing I chose him for.
                </li>
                <li>He made his first suit out of simple equipment, which teaches you
                    that if you want something, <span class="colorneed"> you can do it.</span> </li>
                <li>He appears to be proficient in mechanical engineering, electronics
                    engineering, and software engineering, and because I love engineering, I have already studied
                    these
                    three engineering fields.</li>
                <li>Because he always learns from his mistakes and always develops
                    himself, and this is what a successful engineer does.</li>
                <li>When he makes a mistake, he apologizes, and this is one of the
                    qualities of <span class="stylingneed">good men,</span> not just superheroes.</li>
                <li>He runs one of the most efficient companies, and nowadays some
                    engineers are doing it, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others. And we can learn the good things
                    from them.</li>
                <li>Some of his superpowers are based on science that can be applied in
                    our current days, and indeed some made such suits.</li>
                <li>I know that I need a lot of time, knowledge, and hard work to
                    achieve great things, but who knows <span class="stylingneed">where I can reach?</span></li>
            </ul>
